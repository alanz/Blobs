1. Seems there can only be ONE edge between nodes. Why?
   - Check is done at Network.hs:454-455.
   - Parameterise the Network module to set whether these checks
     should be done or not
  DONE

2. File Load/Save should deal with the whole doc, not just the current
   network
  DONE

3. Check if Descriptor is actually the same as Labeled, and replace it
   if so

4. Multiple palettes, associated with the pages.
   Q: one palette per net (easiest, but ugly), or set of palettes and
   mapping?

   Current expectation is one palette per network. Hmmm.

Assuming one palette per network, potentially different for each

4.1 Change the UI to reflect palette for currently viewed
   network==page

4.2 make provision to change the palette associated with the network.
    BUT: this should be driven by the logic of the kind of diagram
   being constructed.



5. Operations. Need to update to be multi-page aware
